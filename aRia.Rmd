## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
### Load your libraries.
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
### Load csv file
read_csv("NYPD Arrest Data (2020 YTD Oct. 30).csv")
```
```{r}
### Not sure why I did this since dplyr was alrady loaded? But I was following some steps I found on Stack Overflow.
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
### Create a new dataframe so that the alterations have somewhere to go. But why isn't it showing up in the environment page?
.nypd_2020_test_sheet <- "NYPD Arrest Data (2020 YTD Oct. 30).csv"

### THE FOLLOWING CODE DID NOT WORK WHICH IS WHY I COMMENTED IT OUT
### select(.nypd_2020_test_sheet, -c(1,15,16,17,18,19))
```
```{r}

```
